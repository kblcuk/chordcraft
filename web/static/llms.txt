# ChordCraft

> A multi-platform tool for bidirectional chord-fingering conversion, supporting guitar, ukulele, and other stringed instruments.

## Overview

ChordCraft is a web application and CLI tool built with Rust (core) and SvelteKit (web) that provides:

1. **Chord → Fingering**: Input chord names (e.g., "Abm7", "Cmaj7") to get multiple playable fingering options
2. **Fingering → Chord**: Input tab notation (e.g., "x32010") to identify the chord
3. **Progression Optimization**: Input chord sequences to get optimal fingering transitions

## Key Features

- **Multi-instrument support**: Guitar (6-string standard tuning) and ukulele (GCEA re-entrant tuning)
- **Voicing types**: Core (essential notes), Full (all chord tones), Jazzy (extended voicings)
- **Advanced options**: Capo support (0-12 frets), position preferences, playing context (solo/band)
- **Smart algorithms**: Playability scoring, transition optimization, voice leading
- **Fast performance**: Rust core compiled to WebAssembly (~213KB bundle)

## Technology Stack

- **Core**: Rust music theory library with algorithmic fingering generation
- **Web**: SvelteKit 2 with Svelte 5 (runes mode), Tailwind CSS 4
- **Build**: Static site generation (pre-rendered HTML for SEO)
- **WASM**: wasm-pack for browser integration

## Main Routes

- `/find` - Find fingerings for chord names
- `/name` - Identify chords from tab notation
- `/progression` - Optimize chord progressions for smooth transitions

## Use Cases

- Musicians learning new chords and voicings
- Songwriters finding optimal chord progressions
- Teachers demonstrating multiple fingering options
- Music theory students understanding chord construction

## Open Source

- Repository: https://github.com/yourusername/chordcraft
- License: AGPL-3.0-or-later
- Built with: Rust, SvelteKit, WASM, Tailwind CSS

## Technical Details

The application uses:
- Algorithmic fingering generation (not database-driven)
- Interval-based chord theory system
- Physical playability constraints (stretch, finger count, barre detection)
- Transition scoring for progression optimization
- Pre-rendered static HTML for fast loading and SEO
